# _Lab 11 - React_

- for each folder (back and front) run _npm install_ and _npm start_ (have 2 terminals open and running at all times so that the client application can communicate with our server)
- for the backend application you have a route named /sync (full path: http://localhost:5002/api/recipes/sync) that adds some entries to the database - use it via postman so that you have some initial data


In this lab, we can see some basic operations in a React apps - this is a simple example of a _CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)_ application:
- render a list of recipes read from backend
- add a new recipe via a form
- edit an existing recipe
- delete a recipe
