# _Lab 12 - React Router & Redux_

- in this lab, we're continuing the example started in the last lab
- use React Router https://reactrouter.com/en/main
- basic Redux example (setting up a store, reducers, actions - basic set on global store)
- for a more complex Redux example follow these 2 videos - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCAcpym7JCU) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGGYz5vr2Ec)

- for each folder (back and front) run _npm install_ and _npm start_ (have 2 terminals open and running at all times so that the client application can communicate with our server)
- for the backend application you have a route named /sync (full path: http://localhost:5002/api/recipes/sync) that adds some entries to the database - use it via postman so that you have some initial data
