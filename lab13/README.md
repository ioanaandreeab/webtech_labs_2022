# _Lab 13 - Third party components in React (Material UI)_

- in this lab, we're starting with the code base from lab11 and modifying it so we can use components from the Material UI library 

https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/

- check out overview, installation, usage, components and components API

- for each folder (back and front) run _npm install_ and _npm start_ (have 2 terminals open and running at all times so that the client application can communicate with our server)
- for the backend application you have a route named /sync (full path: http://localhost:5002/api/recipes/sync) that adds some entries to the database - use it via postman so that you have some initial data
